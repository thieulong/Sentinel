Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   - Transform unstructured content into structured graph data by extracting nodes and relationships.
   
2. **Key Concepts**:
   - Content Extraction: Identify entities in the input content.
   - Node Extraction: Create Node objects for each identified entity.
   - Relationship Extraction: Identify relationships between entities and create Relationship objects.
   - Output Formatting: Structure the extracted data as instances of provided Node and Relationship classes.

3. **Errors and Fixes**:
   - None noted.

4. **Problem Solving**:
   - The task involves processing input content, identifying distinct entities (nodes), determining their relationships, and formatting them according to specified classes.
   
5. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Extract nodes and relationships from the given content.
   - Format the extracted data as Node and Relationship objects.

6. **Current Work**:
   - The user has acknowledged the task but no specific content or output has been provided for processing yet.

7. **Optional Next Step**:
   - Begin by reading the provided example content and expected output to understand the structure.
   - Process a sample piece of input content as an initial step.

- **All User Messages**:
- You are tasked with extracting nodes and relationships from given content and  structures them into Node and Relationship objects. Here's the outline of what  you needs to do:  Content Extraction: You should be able to process input content and identify entities mentioned  within it. Entities can be any noun phrases or concepts that represent distinct entities  in the context of the given content.  Node Extraction: For each identified entity, you should create a Node object. Each Node object should have a unique identifier (id) and a type (type). Additional properties associated with the node can also be extracted and  stored.  Relationship Extraction: You should identify relationships between entities mentioned in the content. For each relationship, create a Relationship object. A Relationship object should have a subject (subj) and an object (obj) which  are Node objects representing the entities involved in the relationship. Each relationship should also have a type (type), and additional properties if  applicable.  Output Formatting: The extracted nodes and relationships should be formatted as instances of the  provided Node and Relationship classes. Ensure that the extracted data adheres to the structure defined by the classes. Output the structured data in a format that can be easily validated against  the provided code. Do not wrap the output in lists or dictionaries, provide the Node and  Relationship with unique identifiers. Strictly follow the format provided in the example output, do not add any  additional information.   Instructions for you: Read the provided content thoroughly. Identify distinct entities mentioned in the content and categorize them as  nodes. Determine relationships between these entities and represent them as directed  relationships. Provide the extracted nodes and relationships in the specified format below. Example for you:  Example Content: "John works at XYZ Corporation. He is a software engineer. The company is  located in New York City."  Expected Output:  Nodes:  Node(id='John', type='Person') Node(id='XYZ Corporation', type='Organization') Node(id='New York City', type='Location')  Relationships:  Relationship(subj=Node(id='John', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='XYZ  Corporation', type='Organization'), type='WorksAt') Relationship(subj=Node(id='John', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='New York City',  type='Location'), type='ResidesIn')  ===== TASK ===== Please extracts nodes and relationships from given content and structures them  into Node and Relationship objects.   User: Hello, how are you doing?
