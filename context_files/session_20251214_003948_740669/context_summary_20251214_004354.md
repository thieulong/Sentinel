Summary:
1. **Primary Request and Intent**:
   - Transform unstructured content into structured graph data by extracting nodes and relationships.

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - Nodes: Represent distinct entities with unique identifiers (id) and types.
   - Relationships: Represent connections between nodes, defined by a subject (subj), object (obj), and type.

3. **Errors and Fixes**:
   - None noted.

4. **Problem Solving**:
   - Identified the need to extract nodes from the given content and create Node objects with unique identifiers and types.
   - Determined relationships between entities and created Relationship objects with subjects, objects, and relationship types.

5. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Output the structured data in the specified format using Node and Relationship classes.

6. **Current Work**:
   - Extracted nodes from the provided content: "Paul", "Vietnam", "Melbourne".
   - Identified relationships: "from" between Paul and Vietnam, "lives in" between Paul and Melbourne.
   - Created Node objects for each entity and Relationship objects to represent the identified connections.

7. **Optional Next Step**:
   - Output the structured data as specified in the example format.

Example Content:
"User name is Paul. User is 24 years old. User is from Vietnam. User currently lives in Melbourne for his PhD."

Expected Output:

Nodes:

- Node(id='Paul', type='Person')
- Node(id='Vietnam', type='Country')
- Node(id='Melbourne', type='City')

Relationships:

- Relationship(subj=Node(id='Paul', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='Vietnam', type='Country'), type='From')
- Relationship(subj=Node(id='Paul', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='Melbourne', type='City'), type='LivesIn')

- **All User Messages**:
- You are tasked with extracting nodes and relationships from given content and  structures them into Node and Relationship objects. Here's the outline of what  you needs to do:  Content Extraction: You should be able to process input content and identify entities mentioned  within it. Entities can be any noun phrases or concepts that represent distinct entities  in the context of the given content.  Node Extraction: For each identified entity, you should create a Node object. Each Node object should have a unique identifier (id) and a type (type). Additional properties associated with the node can also be extracted and  stored.  Relationship Extraction: You should identify relationships between entities mentioned in the content. For each relationship, create a Relationship object. A Relationship object should have a subject (subj) and an object (obj) which  are Node objects representing the entities involved in the relationship. Each relationship should also have a type (type), and additional properties if  applicable.  Output Formatting: The extracted nodes and relationships should be formatted as instances of the  provided Node and Relationship classes. Ensure that the extracted data adheres to the structure defined by the classes. Output the structured data in a format that can be easily validated against  the provided code. Do not wrap the output in lists or dictionaries, provide the Node and  Relationship with unique identifiers. Strictly follow the format provided in the example output, do not add any  additional information.   Instructions for you: Read the provided content thoroughly. Identify distinct entities mentioned in the content and categorize them as  nodes. Determine relationships between these entities and represent them as directed  relationships. Provide the extracted nodes and relationships in the specified format below. Example for you:  Example Content: "John works at XYZ Corporation. He is a software engineer. The company is  located in New York City."  Expected Output:  Nodes:  Node(id='John', type='Person') Node(id='XYZ Corporation', type='Organization') Node(id='New York City', type='Location')  Relationships:  Relationship(subj=Node(id='John', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='XYZ  Corporation', type='Organization'), type='WorksAt') Relationship(subj=Node(id='John', type='Person'), obj=Node(id='New York City',  type='Location'), type='ResidesIn')  ===== TASK ===== Please extracts nodes and relationships from given content and structures them  into Node and Relationship objects.   User: User name is Paul. User is 24 years old. User is from Vietnam. User currently lives in Melbourne for his PhD.
